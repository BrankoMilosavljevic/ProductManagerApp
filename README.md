# ProductManagerApp - Refactoring
Simple app consisting from web API and WinForms client for managing products

This was a simple (and quite badly written) app built in October 2016 for the purposes of demonstration how WinForm app can communicate 
through web API with server side.
In February of 2018, I decided to try refactoring of an App without changing crucial part of the system (the limit was not to change
anything I would change if the App is in production).
